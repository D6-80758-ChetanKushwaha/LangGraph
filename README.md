🚀 LangGraph Multi-Agent Handoff System with Human-in-the-Loop

This project demonstrates a production-ready multi-agent architecture built using LangGraph, implementing:
	•	🔄 Agent Handoff (RAG → Travel Agent → RAG)
	•	🧠 Dynamic Routing using LLM classification
	•	👤 Human-in-the-Loop confirmation before switching agents
	•	🗂 Subgraph orchestration for clean modular design
	•	💾 Persistent thread memory using SQLite checkpointer
	•	⚙️ Command-based flow control using LangGraph’s goto mechanism

This repository is ideal for anyone building agentic systems, RAG pipelines, or workflow-driven applications with LangGraph.
